# The GlitchPy code
The code infers properties of the acoustic glitches and derives frequency ratios for the sun-like main-sequence stars. It can be used to measure the He and CZ glitch parameters following two different approaches: (1) by fitting the individual oscillation frequencies; and (2) by fitting the second differences of frequencies w.r.t. the radial order. These approaches along with the optimization method have been described in Verma et al. (2019) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.4678V/abstract).

## Setup
The code requires standard python packages including h5py (version 3.6.0 or later), numpy (version 1.21.4 or later), scipy (version 1.7.3 or later) and sklearn (version 0.21.3 or later). 
The code can be downloaded via the usual git clone:
git clone https://github.com/kuldeepv89/GlitchPy.git
